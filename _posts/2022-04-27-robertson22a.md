title: Artificial Emotions for Rapid Online Explorative Learning
abstract: For decades, A.I. has been able to produce impressive results on hard problems,
  such as games playing in synthetic environments, but have had difficulty in interfacing
  with the natural world. Recently machine learning has enabled A.I. to interface
  more robustly with the real world. Statistical methods for speech understanding
  opened the door to voice-based systems and more recently deep-learning has revolutionized
  computer vision to the extent that wild speculation now predicts artificial superintelligence
  surpassing human intelligence, but we are a few major breakthroughs short of that
  being achieved. We know what some of these breakthroughs need to be. We need to
  replace supervised learning with unsupervised learning and we need to take on topics
  like motivation, attention, and emotions. In this article, we describe an architecture
  that touches on some of these issues drawing inspiration from neuroscience. We describe
  three aspects of the architecture in this article that address learning through
  fear and reward and address the focus of attention. These three systems are intimately
  linked in mammalian brains. We believe that this work represents an attempt to bridge
  the gap between high order reasoning and base-level support for motivation and learning
  in robots.
