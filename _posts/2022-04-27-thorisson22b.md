title: The "Explanation Hypothesis" in General Self-Supervised Learning
abstract: Self-supervised learning is the ability of an agent to improve its own performance,
  with respect to one or more goals related to one or more phenomena, without outside
  help from a teacher or other external aid tailored to the agent’s learning progress.
  A general learner’s learning process is not limited to a strict set of topics, tasks,
  or domains. Selfsupervised and general learning machines are still in the early
  stages of development, as are learning machines that can explain their own knowledge,
  goals, actions, and reasoning. Research on explanation proper has to date been largely
  limited to the field of philosophy of science. In this paper I present the hypothesis
  that general self-supervised learning requires (a particular kind of) explanation
  generation, and review some key arguments for and against it. Named the explanation
  hypothesis (ExH), the claim rests on three main pillars. First, that any good explanation
  of a phenomenon requires reference to relations between sub-parts of that phenomenon,
  as well as to its context (other phenomena and their parts), especially (but not
  only) causal relations. Second, that self-supervised general learning of a new phenomenon
  requires (a kind of) bootstrapping, and that this - and subsequent improvement on
  the initial knowledge thus produced - relies on reasoning processes. Third, that
  general self-supervised learning relies on reification of prior knowledge and knowledge-generation
  processes, which can only be implemented through appropriate reflection mechanisms,
  whereby current knowledge and prior learning progress is available for explicit
  inspection by the learning system itself, to be analyzed for use in future learning.
  The claim thus construed has several important implications for the implementation
  of general machine intelligence, including that it will neither be achieved without
  reflection (meta-cognition) nor explicit representation of causal relations, and
  that internal explanation generation must be a fundamental principle of their operation.
