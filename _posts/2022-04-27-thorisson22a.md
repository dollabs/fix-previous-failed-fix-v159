abstract: This collection of papers was presented at the second annual international
  workshop on self- supervised learning(IWSSL2021 held virtually, between August 13
  and August 14, 2021. They represent the state of the art in an expanding field of
  research that attempts to build systems that can learn without human intervention
  with little or no hard-wired domain knowledge, as would a new-born child or animal.
