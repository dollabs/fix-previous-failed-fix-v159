title: Comparison of Machine Learners on an ABA Experiment Format of the Cart-Pole
  Task
abstract: Current approaches to online learning focus primarily on reinforcement learning
  (RL) - algorithms that learn through feedback from experience. While most current
  RL algorithms have shown good results in learning to perform tasks for which they
  were specifically designed, most of them lack a level of generalization needed to
  use existing knowledge to handle novel situations - a property referred to as autonomous
  transfer learning. Situations encountered by such systems which were not present
  during the training phase can lead to critical failure. In the present research
  we analyzed the autonomous transfer learning capabilities of five different machine
  learning approaches - i.e. an Actor-Critic, a Q-Learner, a Policy Gradient Learner,
  a Double-Deep Q-Learner, and OpenNARS for Applications. Following a classic ABA
  experimental format, the learners were all trained on the well-known cart-pole task
  in phase A-1, before strategic changes to the task were introduced in phase B, consisting
  of inverting the direction of control of the cart (move-left command moved the cart
  to the right and vice versa), as well as the introduction of noise. All analyzed
  learners show an extreme performance drop when the action command is inverted in
  phase B, resulting in long (re-)training periods trying to reach A1 performance.
  Most learners do not reach initial A1 performance levels in phase B, some falling
  very far from them. Furthermore, previously learned knowledge is not retained during
  the re-training, resulting in an even larger performance drop when the task is changed
  back to the original settings in phase A2. Only one learner (NARS) reached comparable
  performance in A1 and A2, demonstrating retention of, and return to, priorly-acquired
  knowledge.
